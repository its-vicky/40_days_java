# 40_days_java
I am announcing a 40-day code challenge in Java programming using its basic concepts. I'm connecting to the Java programming language. Learn the new concepts to make it easier for me to get a perfect developer.
Well, there are a lot of topics and things to cover. I am targeting some big tech companies. The challenge is the limited timeframe, and based on our research, we need to say that it may take almost 6 weeks, or 40 days. We have divided the complete topics into 40 days, and all you have to do is follow them and stay committed to coding for 40 days.
